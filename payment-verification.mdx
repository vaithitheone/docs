## What is payment verification?

During onboarding, we securely verify your payment method via Razorpay. A small authorization amount may be temporarily charged and then automatically refunded. This does not start your paid subscription.

<Info>
The authorization is reversed shortly after verification. Refund timing depends on your bank or card issuer.
</Info>

## When you are charged

- Your trial runs until its end date
- You are only charged after the trial ends
- The amount charged matches the plan you selected during sign‑up
